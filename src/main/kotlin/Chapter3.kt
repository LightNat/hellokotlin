/*
    1. Create a constant called age1 and set it equal to 42. Create a constant called age2
        and set it equal to 21. Check using Control+Shift+P that the type for both has
        been inferred correctly as Int.
    2. Create a constant called avg1 and set it equal to the average of age1 and age2
        using the naive operation (age1 + age2) / 2. Use Control+Shift+P to check the
        type and check the result of avg1. Why is it wrong?
    3. Correct the mistake in the above exercise by converting age1 and age2 to type
        Double in the formula. Use Control+Shift+P to check the type and check the
        result of avg1. Why is it now correct?
*/

//Mini exercise B
/*
    1. Create a string constant called firstName and initialize it to your first name.
        Also create a string constant called lastName and initialize it to your last name.
    2. Create a string constant called fullName by adding the firstName and lastName
        constants together, separated by a space.
    3. Using string templates, create a string constant called myDetails that uses the
        fullName constant to create a string introducing yourself. For example, it could
        read: "Hello, my name is Joe Howard.".
*/

//Mini exercise C
/*
    1. Declare a constant Triple that contains three Int values. Use this to represent a
        date (month, day, year).
    2. Extract the values in the triple into three constants named month, day and year.
    3. In one line, read the month and year values into two constants. Youâ€™ll need to
        employ the underscore to ignore the day.
    4. Since the values inside Pairs and Triples cannot be modified, you will need to
        extract the values from them, make any modifications you want, and then create
        a new Pair or Triple. Using the values you extracted in step three, modify the
        month value and create a new Pair containing the modified month along with
        the unmodified year.
